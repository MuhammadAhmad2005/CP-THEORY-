In this project, we are going to convert temperatures into Celsius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit and their interconversions. The temperature input is taken from the user and as per the user need the temperatures convert into other temperatures. We are using switch case for different conversions. We give the conversions in the functions so that we donâ€™t have to write them again and again. The user just has to give the choices for conversions.
